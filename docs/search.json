The CFExpress cards are really fast, but they also heat up quite a bit when downloading off the cards, so smaller is probably better so there are not multiple thousands of pictures on each card.\nCFExpress Type B 128 GB\nSDXC 256 GB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, Stella’s fur is getting longer up here in the arctic and we constantly have Stella fur bunnies, so I need a brush for her and always forget to get one. Something like this would be great for her! Wood Dog Brush\nThanks for reading, and looking forward to see y’all at the Thanksgiving House!"
